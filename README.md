# RateMe_MobileApplication
Allows a user to rate their favorite movies and save them

This application uses an Open Movie Database API. You must request an API key from `https://www.omdbapi.com/` in order for the app to work. Once you've request an API key,
go to your local.properties file in the project and paste the following key value pairs to get started: 

- `OMDb_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`.
- `USER_APP_DATA_FILENAME=SAVE_FILE_NAME` (the value here can be any name you'd like to call your 'save' file for the user's data, e.g. "UserAppData")
